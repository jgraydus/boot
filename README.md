This is an attempt to bootstrap a programming language.

current status:
- stage0
  - simple lisp-syntax language
  - interpreter written in `x86_64` assembly
  - `cd stage0 && make test`

future work:
- stage1
  - language closer to a real scheme implementation 

- stage2
  - implement a widely-used language
